## Employee Monitoring App

Employee Monitor App is an application to monitor employee performance developed using Flutter. This application is made so that supervisors from a company can monitor the performance of their employees' progress. The supervisor can create groups for employees, assign tasks to employees, create rewards, track tasks that have been completed, and more.
